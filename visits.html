							While coming to Canada,I had an amazing 2 days stay in Ukraine's capital city called Kyiv. It a very beautiful city to visit.
							Me and my two friends stayed at hotel with amazing scenic view in the downtown of the city.
							</p>
							<p>Some Information about Kyiv: Kyiv or Kiev is the capital and most populous city of Ukraine. It is in north-central Ukraine along the Dnieper River. As of 1 January 2021, its population was 2,962,180, making Kyiv the seventh-most populous city in Europe.<br>
							The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. 
							During its history, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. 
							The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century</p>

							Chandigarh is called the City Beautiful of India and i have spent most of my life in this city. I did my graduation for a college in chandigarh and i used to bunk my classes to visit tourist places nearby.
							Chandigarh, the capital of the northern Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, was designed by the Swiss-French modernist architect, Le Corbusier. His buildings include the Capitol Complex with its High Court, Secretariat and Legislative Assembly, as well as the giant Open Hand Monument. 
							The nearby Rock Garden is a park featuring sculptures made of stones, recycled ceramics and industrial relics.

							The Golden Temple is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. 
							It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. </p>
							<p>
							The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.
							In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.
							The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal, political parties and invading Afghan armies. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, 
							and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple
