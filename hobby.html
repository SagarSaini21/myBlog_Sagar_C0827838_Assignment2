							 My favorite hobby is playing video games. Yes, you might be thinking “How does gaming reduce your stress levels”. 
							 I’ll explain how. You see in a world full of competitiveness, I have found my passion and named it my hobby. 
							 Playing video games helps me to release my stress, also it relaxes me from a hard and long day of school/work. 
							 No, I am talking about the games that actually help you to understand this hard world a lot better. 
							 I am talking about competitive gaming. 
							 People from all over the world, gamers gathering around in an area, being shouted on, and cheered by a few millions of gamers, what’s better than that? Competitive gaming not only helps in actually competing but also develops a sense of “Being the best” in one. 
							 I would almost spend 1/2/3 hr playing video games each day.
							</p>
							
							<b>Here are some advantages of playing video games:</b>

							Many people have painting as a hobby. So do I. I have always been keen of painting ever since my childhood. 
							My mother used to say that even when I was a toddler, I used to take the pen from my father’s desk and then scribble randomly on the floor and the walls of the house. 
							As I started growing older, I took up painting classes and started developing a great deal of interest in it. I always devoted a couple of hours in the evening to painting. 
							My parents had bought me a paint box and a palette, seeing how much I enjoyed painting.
							</p>
							<p>
							I pursued my hobby of painting not only in my house but also at my school. 
							We used to have painting competitions every year in which may students from our school participated. 
							My first participation ended up in a disaster when water was accidentally spilled on the painting I drew.
							I was dejected but I never lost hope. 
							I took part in the competition again next year and I beat a senior student to grab the first prize. 
							Our principal was so taken by my painting of an elderly woman that he asked me to draw something for him. 
							I was really touched by his gesture. My parents were brimming with joy when they heard of the same.
							</p>
							<p>
							When I first began painting and started developing interest in it, I had never thought that it would turn out to become such a huge passion of mine. I now know the importance of having a hobby. 
							A hobby may at times be a hidden passion of a person. 
							You just need to pursue your hobby so as to discover if it really is your passion or not.

							Photography is a vast subject, there are so many subjects to choose from on which to master and which one would enjoy. 
							I love to click mostly the natural ones or the ones that gives me a perfect satisfaction of where I am in. 
							To get good shots, one needs to understand a few concepts of photography like lighting techniques, backgrounds, arrangements and so on, so that when the outcome is done, you get a wonderful shot. 
							Practicing is another method to get your shots to the perfect, the more you practice on your choice of interest, the more better your shots would become. 
							In order to make my shots good , I did take up short courses to learn in detail so that I understand how to take good shots and great snaps that look natural and wonderful.
							</p>
							<p>
							A good photographer would always be in search of good sceneries or events to capture good moments and I am happy to be one among them. 
							I just love shooting, be it outdoor or indoor as I have developed the skill through years of practice.
							</p>
							<p>
							Photography is something that just does not happen overnight. One has to devote time and develop patience and learn the art of good photography. 
							The more I learn, the more I love it and this is one hobby that I am truly in love with and that which I enjoy the most.
